<br> <font face= "verdana", size= "4", color= "sky blue"> <i> Here are times in life... <br>
When the person you will love, <br>
For the rest of your life. <br>
Walks in to your life. <br></font></i>

Sometimes, just sometimes... <br>
You hurt that person <br>
You push them away <br>
Not meaning to <br> 
But you do <br></font></b></u>

At times... <br>

To go on, after this <br>
But what choice do you have? <br></font>

All you can do... <br>
Is hope that one day, <br>
If that person really was the one <br>
You will meet again <br></b>

And if just by chance... <br>
You get that second chance <br>
Remember the past.<br>
Learn from your mistakes,<br>
And never let them happen again.<br></font>
